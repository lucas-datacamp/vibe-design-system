# Summer Vibes: Create Your Design System Using Cursor

Foundation repo for the **Summer Vibes** live coding session at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

Clone this before the session starts, open it in Cursor, and follow along as we build a design system from scratch. You do not need to know Astro beforehand. The repo is pre-scaffolded so we can spend the session on taste, systems, and iteration, not boilerplate.

## Requirements

Set these up before we go live:

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) | Free tier is probably enough for the session |
| [Impeccable](https://impeccable.style/) | Already vendored in the repo — nothing to install |
| [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) | Free tier is enough (used later in the session) |
| Node.js 22+ | Required by Astro 6 |

## Get set up in Cursor

When the session starts, clone this repo and open the folder in Cursor.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucas-datacamp/vibe-design-system.git
cd vibe-design-system
```

Then ask Cursor to install dependencies and start the dev server. You can paste something like:

```text
I just cloned this repo to follow the Summer Vibes live coding session. Please install dependencies and run the dev server. Node.js 22+ is required.
```

Cursor should run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). You'll see the **design-system showcase** — palette, type, and components, all in deliberately plain grayscale defaults. That's the point: as you define your tokens during the session, this page reskins live.

### If Cursor asks what to do

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `./dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build |

### Impeccable

Impeccable is **already vendored in this repo** (in `.claude` and `.cursor`) — nothing to install. Each attendee builds their own design system, so `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` stay local and are gitignored.

In Cursor, after the mood board and AI interview:

```text
/impeccable init
```

That creates your personal `PRODUCT.md`. Later, `/impeccable document` creates your `DESIGN.md`. Commands like `/impeccable live` and `/impeccable craft` read from those files.

## About the session

**Format:** Live presentation + live Cursor demo

**Tone:** Playful summer vibes, but serious about craft

### What we cover

1. **What is vibe coding?** The idea (popularized by Andrej Karpathy), and the toolbox: Cursor, v0, Lovable, Claude / Claude Code.
2. **Meet the slop.** A deliberately low-effort prompt to show that generic AI output is real — and why so much of the web looks the same now that code is cheap.
3. **Code got cheap. Taste didn't.** How to make an app feel intentional, not like a high school project pasted out of ChatGPT.
4. **What *is* a design system?** The brands you recognize in one second — Apple, Spotify, Lego, Polestar — and the recipe behind them: tokens, components, and rules. The twist for us: a **vibe coding design system** is built for humans *and* agents. (And no, it's not **System Design** — same words, opposite jobs: visual language vs. engineering architecture.)
5. **Find your taste.** Build a mood board of references you actually like.
6. **AI-assisted interview.** Use an agent to pull out the details of *your* system: palette, type, density, voice, anti-patterns.
7. **Define it live.** Set your tokens with Cursor + [Impeccable](https://impeccable.style/) and watch the showcase reskin in front of you.
8. **Publish it to the open web.** Deploy to Cloudflare Pages so the URL becomes an *agent-readable* design system — tokens, rules, and an installable skill. The URL is the product.
9. **Consume it anywhere.** Point an AI agent at your system and watch it build or refactor a product on-brand — in any stack. That's the whole point.

### Related decks

The talk narrative was shaped in a design session and delivered as HTML slide decks:

- **Summer Vibes Deck** — main session flow (vibe coding → slop → taste → design systems → mood board → interview → build)
- **Design System Anatomy Deck** — companion deck on foundations, components, and connective tissue

Those decks are separate artifacts from this repo. This repository is where we build the design system together during the live demo.

## What's in this repo

Pre-configured scaffold for the session:

| Piece | Version |
| --- | --- |
| [Astro](https://astro.build/) | 6.x |
| [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) | 4.x |
| [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) | 5.x |

Tailwind is wired through the Vite plugin, and the design tokens live in `src/styles/global.css` (`@theme` + `:root`). daisyUI is registered there but left inert (`themes: false`) — the system is built on custom tokens, not daisyUI components.

Dev toolbar is disabled in `astro.config.mjs` so the live demo stays clean.

### The rails (pre-built so the session is about taste, not boilerplate)

- **Neutral token foundation** — `src/styles/global.css` (`@theme`): the live-edit surface that drives everything.
- **Token-driven showcase** — `src/pages/index.astro` + `src/components/ds/*`: palette, type, and component galleries that reskin from the tokens.
- **`publish-system`** — `scripts/publish-system.mjs`, run automatically on every dev/build via an Astro integration. Generates the **agent layer**: `/tokens.json`, `/system.md`, `/tokens.css`, `/llms.txt`, and versioned `/v1/…` (including an installable hosted skill). These are generated, not committed.
- **Skills** — `apply-system` (apply the system to any product) and `publish-system`, shipped in `.claude/skills` + `.cursor/skills` so they're present on clone.
- **Static deploy** — `wrangler.jsonc` configures a static Cloudflare deploy of `./dist`, no SSR adapter needed.

## Closing thought

The dream is a web with diverse, high-quality design that does not depend on a handful of experts alone. Tools like Cursor and Impeccable lower the floor; taste, systems thinking, and deliberate iteration raise the ceiling.

Now go build yours.
